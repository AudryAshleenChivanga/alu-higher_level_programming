Audry Ashleen's  simplified notes:

1. **Why JavaScript is Amazing**: 
   - Popular web programming language.
   - Runs in browsers and servers.
   - Dynamic and versatile.

2. **Running a JavaScript Script**: 
   - Use a browser's developer tools.
   - Use Node.js for server-side.

3. **Creating Variables and Constants**: 
   - Use `var`, `let`, or `const`.

4. **Differences Between var, const, and let**: 
   - `var`: Older declaration, function-scoped.
   - `let`: Block-scoped.
   - `const`: Block-scoped, can't be reassigned.

5. **JavaScript Data Types**: 
   - Number, String, Boolean, Object, Undefined, Null, Symbol, BigInt.

6. **Using If and If...Else Statements**: 
   - Conditional execution based on a condition.

7. **Using Comments**: 
   - Single-line: `//`
   - Multi-line: `/* */`

8. **Assigning Values to Variables**: 
   - Use `=`.

9. **Using While and For Loops**: 
   - `while`: Repeats as long as a condition is true.
   - `for`: Loops through a block of code a number of times.

10. **Using Break and Continue**: 
   - `break`: Exits the loop.
   - `continue`: Skips the rest of the loop's current iteration.

11. **What is a Function**: 
   - A block of reusable code.
   - Defined once, called multiple times.

12. **Function Without Return Statement**: 
   - Returns `undefined`.

13. **Scope of Variables**: 
   - Where a variable can be accessed.
   - Global, function, or block scope.

14. **Arithmetic Operators**: 
   - Add, subtract, multiply, etc.

15. **Manipulating Dictionary**: 
   - Also called objects.
   - Store key-value pairs.

16. **Importing a File**: 
   - Use `import` statement.
